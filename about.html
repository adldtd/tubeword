		<h1>About TubeWord</h1>
		<br>
		
		<div class='about'>
			<p class='about-text'>TubeWord uses a database of Youtube links in order to retrieve links with words in them. Therefore, some words (especially ones with more than six letters)
			may not give back results. Currently, all 2-4 letter English words have at least one link documented alongside them. As more work is completed, this
			number is likely to change. As well as this, a number of Youtube links may be broken.</p>
			
			<p class='about-text'>The database utilizes a modified version of the dwyl english-words text file as its "dictionary"; it can be found at 
			<a href='https://github.com/dwyl/english-words'>https://github.com/dwyl/english-words</a></p>
		
			<p class='about-text'>To request the removal of a Youtube link, or to check if a Youtube link is in the database, email PLACEHOLDER@GMAIL.COM</p>
