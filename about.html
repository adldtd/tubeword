		<br>
		
		<div class='about'>
			<p class='about-text'>TubeWord uses a database of Youtube links, and retrieves links with words embedded in them. Enter different words to get pseudorandom Youtube videos.
			Due to how data was collected, coupled with limits on database space, some words (especially ones with > 4 letters) may not give results. As well as this, a number of links 
			may be broken or removed. Currently, however, all 2-4 letter English words have at least one corresponding link. In the future, these numbers are likely to change.</p>
			
			<p class='about-text'>The database utilizes a modified version of the dwyl english-words text file as its "dictionary"; it can be found at 
			<a href='https://github.com/dwyl/english-words'>https://github.com/dwyl/english-words</a></p>
		
			<p class='about-text'>To request the removal of a link, or to check if a link is located in the database, email PLACEHOLDER@GMAIL.COM</p>
