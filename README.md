# TubeWord

The frontend + backend for the tubeword site, including an SQL database (without the data).

This is a small project I made a while ago based on the observation that some Youtube links have words in them. Hence, the site returns links containing specified words (for example, the youtube link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxDoG3CjITY has the word dog in it). In general, this project really works best as a way to retrieve random Youtube videos. As of now, the website is being hosted at https://tubeword.herokuapp.com.

NOTE: Please do not use this tool to harass, storm, or swarm videos.
